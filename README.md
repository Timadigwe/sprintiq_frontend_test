# Prisma
make sure to run npx prisma db push from the root directory of your app. This command will sync your Prisma schema with your database and will generate the TypeScript types for the Prisma Client based on your schema. Note that you need to restart the TypeScript serverâ†— after doing this so that it can detect the generated types.
